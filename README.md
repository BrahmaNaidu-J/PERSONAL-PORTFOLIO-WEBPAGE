This portfolio website is a project I developed as part of my internship to showcase my frontend development skills and personal brand. The site is fully built using HTML and CSS with a focus on clean design, responsiveness, and a smooth user experience. It starts with a hero section that introduces me as a frontend developer, followed by a “What I Can Do For You” section where I highlight my core skills: Web Development, App Development, and UI/UX Design. Each of these services is explained briefly and presented in a clean card layout with supporting visuals. A key feature of this website is the Projects section, where I’ve included three practical projects I’ve worked on: a Real-Time Chat Application, an Interactive Quiz Application, and an E-Learning Platform UI. These projects reflect my understanding of user interface design, responsiveness, and frontend logic. The layout is designed using flexbox and follows mobile-first principles, ensuring it looks great on all screen sizes. I also included an “About Me” section to share a short summary of my journey as a B.Tech CSE student who is passionate about web technologies and eager to learn and grow in the tech field. The “Contact Me” section contains my email for collaboration or job opportunities. This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of HTML/CSS structuring, modern layout techniques, design thinking, and how to present skills in a professional way. It’s a solid foundation that I plan to expand by adding interactivity with JavaScript and eventually deploying it online. This portfolio reflects both my current capabilities and my enthusiasm to become a better frontend developer.
